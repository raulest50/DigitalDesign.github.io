    <div>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p1>
            AMBA AXI is a bus communication protocol created by ARM. It is used by many Xilinx IP blocks 
            and  possibly other businesses. AXI4 Lite is a simplified version of AXI4 since employ less signals.
            The spirit of the mechanism remains the same, though simpler. In this lecture, only the Lite version 
            is to be considered.
        </p1>

    <div>
        <h2>Channels</h2>
        <p>
            The AXI4 communication protocol consis of 5 communication channels, listed above
        </p>
        <ul>
            <ol>Address Write Channel</ol>
            <ol>Data Write Channel</ol>
            <ol>Read Response Channel</ol>
            <ol>Address Read Channel</ol>
            <ol>Data Read Channel</ol>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All five channels implements a HandShake mechanism. But first, lets explain the purpose of each
            channel. 
        </p>

        
        <h3>Address Write Channel</h3>
        <p>
            In this channel the master tells the slave which address wants to write at.
            An address valid bit is set to high to signal the slave the masters wants to especify
            an address for a write operation. When slave is ready to read the address, sets 
            the read ready bit to high. Then this channel consis of an address bus, a data valid
            and a read ready wires.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Write Channel</h3>
        <p>
            equally important is the data to be written at the specified address. The data bus consist of 
            32 bits and there is also a data valid bit and read ready bit. The mechanism is the same
        </p>

        <h3>Write Response Channel</h3>
        <p>
            Once the write operation, handled by the two previous channels, is complete, The master would
            like to know if it was succesfull. This channel two bit bus for the slave to tell the master 
            if write succeded or an error happened. also has a data valid bit to signal the master that is 
            ok to read the response status. When the master already read the write response status then has 
            to set read ready bit to high to tell the slave.
        </p>

        <h3>Address Read Channel</h3>
        <p>
            The same way the master has to specify which address wants to read at. This channel has then an 
            address bus, a read address valid and read address ready bits.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Read Channel</h3>
        <p>
            The slave drives the data bus and the master is who reads it. In this bus the slave puts the data 
            stored at the address specified by the master in the read address channel.

        </p>

        <h2>Vivadado VHDL Simulations</h2>
        <p>
            A very good way to understand how protocol works is with a practical example. Here
            the AXI4-LITE UART IP block from xilinx is goint to be instantiated in a test bench
            with VHDL to see how it behaves. It is useful to understand beforehand the UART
            protocol.
