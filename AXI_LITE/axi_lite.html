        <h1>AXI4 Lite</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p1>
            AMBA AXI is a bus communication protocol created by ARM. It is used by many Xilinx IP blocks 
            and  possibly other businesses. AXI4 Lite is a simplified version of AXI4 since employ less signals.
            The spirit of the mechanism remains the same, though simpler. In this lecture, only the Lite version 
            is to be considered.
        </p1>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Channels</h2>
        <p>
            The AXI4 communication protocol consis of 5 communication channels, listed above
        </p>
        <ul>
            <ol>Address Write Channel</ol>
            <ol>Data Write Channel</ol>
            <ol>Read Response Channel</ol>
            <ol>Address Read Channel</ol>
            <ol>Data Read Channel</ol>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All five channels implements a HandShake mechanism. But first, lets explain the purpose of each
            channel. 
        </p>

        
        <h3>Address Write Channel</h3>
        <p>
            In this channel the master tells the slave which address wants to write at.
            An address valid bit is set to high to signal the slave the masters wants to especify
            an address for a write operation. When slave is ready to read the address, sets 
            the read ready bit to high. Then this channel consis of an address bus, a data valid
            and a read ready wires.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Write Channel</h3>
        <p>
            equally important is the data to be written at the specified address. The data bus consist of 
            32 bits and there is also a data valid bit and read ready bit. The mechanism is the same
        </p>

        <h3>Write Response Channel</h3>
        <p>
            Once the write operation, handled by the two previous channels, is complete, The master would
            like to know if it was succesfull. This channel two bit bus for the slave to tell the master 
            if write succeded or an error happened. also has a data valid bit to signal the master that is 
            ok to read the response status. When the master already read the write response status then has 
            to set read ready bit to high to tell the slave.
        </p>

        <h3>Address Read Channel</h3>
        <p>
            The same way the master has to specify which address wants to read at. This channel has then an 
            address bus, a read address valid and read address ready bits.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Read Channel</h3>
        <p>
            The slave drives the data bus and the master is who reads it. In this bus the slave puts the data 
            stored at the address specified by the master in the read address channel.

        </p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>HandShake mechanism</h2>
        <p>
            The master is responsible to drive bus data in Address Write, Data Write and Address Read Channels.
            Hence the master is also responsible of driving the corresponding data valid signals.
            The valid signal in each channel tells the slave that is permitted to read the bus data.
            the latter applies to all channels. For Write Response and Data Read channel the responsible to 
            drive the valid signals is the slave since it is also the slave who sets the data in those
            channels. The one who reads the data in the bus can tell the other part it has finished to read
            the data by setting the ready bit to high. The Address Write Ready to name an example.
        </p>

        <p>The enforced rules are:</p>

        <ul>
            <ol>
                When a VALID (AxVALID/xVALID) signal is asserted, it must remain asserted until the rising clock edge after the slave asserts AxREADY/xREADY.
            </ol>
            <ol>
                the VALID signal of the AXI interface sending information must not be dependent on the READY 
                signal of the AXI interface receiving that information
                However, the state of the READY signal can depend on the VALID signal
            </ol>
            <ol>
                A write response must always follow the last write transfer in the write transaction 
                of which it is a part
            </ol>
            <ol>
                Read data must always follow the address to which the data relates
            </ol>
            <ol>
                A slave must wait for both ARVALID and ARREADY to be asserted before it asserts RVALID 
                to indicate that valid data is available
            </ol>
        </ul>

        <h2>Vivadado VHDL Simulations</h2>
        <p>
            To transmit by UART the byte 0x82, one has to set the address 0x04 in the AXI UART, which 
            is the Tx FIFO register. The Address 0x04 is set in the Address Write channel and the byte 0x82
            is set in the Data Write bus as can be apreciated in the image below. When both data valids
            in address and data write channels is set to 1, the UART slave start to read the data. It is 
            supposed that communication is atomic and each channel works independently. But in practice
            transmission only started when both data valids were set to 1. Afterwards the read ready in both
            channels are set to 1 by the UART slave.

            The communication baud rate in this simulation is 115200 and the clock frequency is 100Mhz.
            Hence the handshake process is more faster than transmission speed so Tx timing diagram 
            is shown in separate image below.

            To send multiple bytes is very convenient to enable interrupts in the CTRL_REG. After 
            transmission in Tx pin is finished, the interrupt pin will signal a pulse.
